# TrendSync

## Project Overview

TrendSync is a software system developed for Trend Moving and Storage, designed to streamline job dispatching, contract signing, and crew management. 
This system aims to enhance the efficiency of Trend Moving and Storage's operations and provide a better experience for both employees and customers.

## Key Features

- **Job Assignment:** Easily dispatch crew members to jobs with a user-friendly interface.
- **Contract Signing:** Enable customers to sign contracts electronically for a seamless experience.
- **Crew Management:** Empower crew leaders to modify job details and manage assignments effectively.

## Project Goals

- Develop a scalable and adaptable system for Trend Moving and Storage.
- Implement a fully cross-platform solution for Desktop, iOS, and Android.
- Integrate payment processing using APIs for convenient transactions.
- Implement PDF document signing to streamline the contract process.
- Accurately match and emulate the current system with improvements in workflow, UI/UX, and functionality.

## Project Structure

The project follows the PADI model (Planning, Analysis, Design, and Implementation). The development timeline is divided into distinct phases, including planning, analysis, design, and implementation.

### Timeline

- **Weeks 1-2:** Assess, document, and map the current system.
- **Weeks 3-4:** Analyze non/functional requirements and document them.
- **Weeks 5-6:** Design backend (Choose cloud server and database) and any code that will go along with it.
- **Weeks 7-8:** Design frontend (layout each page across all platforms).
- **Weeks 9-10:** Begin implementation.
- **Weeks 11-12:** Finish the Backend (setup server, database, backend code).
- **Weeks 13-14:** Finish Frontend (Website, IOS, Android, Desktop).
- **Weeks 15-16:** Test system and fix any problems found in testing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- node
- npm

### Installation

1. Clone the Github repository.
2. cd into the Server directory.
3. run node index.js, This will start up the backend.
4. now cd into the client directory.
5. run npm run dev (you may need to install vite, install it with npm i vite).
6. for the mobile app you will need to install expo go and create an account.
7. then run npm i expo.
8. once that is installed you can run npx expo start (This starts a server running a build of the mobile app that expo go can connect to).

The database may no longer be hosted when you try to use this system, so you may get some errors and the system won't work properly.

### Usage

1. Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:5174](http://localhost:5174).
2. You will be prompted to log in or create an account.
3. Explore the user interface to manage job assignments, contracts, and crew scheduling.
